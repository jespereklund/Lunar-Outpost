This game is written in Svelte and uses SVG for the graphics. 

The aim is to stear a small spaceship through a series of labyrinths. 

The game model and the view is separated, so the model is not depending on the view.

The view could therefore be replaced with a canvas without any change to the model. 

The combination of Sveltes dynamic curly brace variables in the declaretive part of the code works very well together with the visual SVG elements.
